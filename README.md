# **Sakila Data Warehouse Project**  

## 🎯 About This Project  
This repo is all about building a **Data Warehouse** using the **Sakila database** (a sample MySQL database for a DVD rental business). It includes SQL scripts to create the warehouse, run analytical queries, and generate insights. Plus, there’s an exported dataset for Tableau visualizations.  

## 📂 What’s Inside  
- **`Data Warehouse.sql`** – Builds the Data Warehouse and loads data.  
- **`Queries.sql`** – Contains SQL queries to pull insights from the Data Warehouse.  
- **`Sakila Data.csv`** – Data extracted for Tableau visualizations.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **SQL & MySQL** – For building the Data Warehouse and running queries.  

## 🚀 How to Use This  
### **1️⃣ Set Up the Database**  
1. Run `sakila-schema.sql` to create the Sakila database.  
2. Load `sakila-data.sql` to add sample data.  
3. Run `Data Warehouse.sql` to create the **Data Warehouse** version of the dataset.  

### **2️⃣ Run Some Queries**  
- Open `Queries.sql` and execute the queries to analyze trends.  
- Queries include **customer behavior, rental trends, revenue insights, inventory tracking,** and more.  

## 📊 What’s Covered?  
- **Data Warehouse Design** – Pulled data from multiple tables & created a structured dataset.  
- **SQL Analysis** – Wrote queries to uncover key insights.
